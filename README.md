# Credit Card Approval Prediction

## Overview
This GitHub repository hosts a machine learning project focused on predicting credit card approval for individuals. The project employs classification algorithms to determine whether an applicant is eligible for a credit card based on various features and historical data.

## Problem Statement
Access to credit cards is essential for many individuals, and financial institutions need effective ways to evaluate creditworthiness. This project addresses the problem of credit card approval by developing a machine learning model that can make informed decisions based on a set of applicant attributes.

## Data
We use a dataset containing historical information about credit card applicants, including features such as income, age, employment status, and more. The dataset is available in the folder and can be accessed [Credit-Card](https://github.com/SumitAkhadkar/Prediction-of-Credit-Card-Approval/blob/main/Credit_card.csv) and [Credit-Card-Label](https://github.com/SumitAkhadkar/Prediction-of-Credit-Card-Approval/blob/main/Credit_card_label.csv).

## Machine Learning Techniques
We leverage various classification algorithms to build and evaluate predictive models. Some of the algorithms explored in this project include:
- Logistic Regression
- Decision Trees
- Random Forest
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- KNN
- XGBoost

## Evaluation Metrics
The performance of each model is assessed using a range of evaluation metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure a comprehensive assessment of model performance.

## Project Structure
The project repository is organized as follows:
- **Data:** Contains the dataset used for training and testing.
- **Notebook:** Jupyter notebook with data preprocessing, model development, and evaluation.
- **Models:** Saved model checkpoints.
- **Results:** Model performance metrics, visualizations, and reports.

## Usage
To run the project and reproduce the results, follow the instructions provided in the `README.md` file. Make sure to install the required dependencies such as NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, etc.
